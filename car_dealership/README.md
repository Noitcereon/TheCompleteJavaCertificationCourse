# Lecture 20: PRACTICAL PROJECT - Car me.noitcereon.car_dealership.Dealership

"Write a program to simulate a car dealership sales process. We'll have eomployees, working selling vehicles to customers."

The program should contain the following:
- Customer class
- Employee class
- Vehicle class
- Dealership class (entry point)

The flow below should be handled.
```java
/**
 * handleCustomer(Customer cust, boolean finance, Vehicle vehicle)
 *  if(finance == true)
 *      runCreditHistory(Customer cust, double doubleAmount)
 *  else if (vehicle.getPrice() <= cust.getCashOnHand());
 *      processTransaction(Customer cust, Vehicle vehicle
 *  else:
 *      tell customer to bring more money.
 */
```

Note: I will only make a bare-bones solution, because this is very basic code I already have a grasp on.

The biggest challenge here is working with the provided framework, because I don't understand the 'finance' boolean.
